- Syntax parser - A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid.
- Lexical environment - Where something sits physically in the code you write.
- Execution context - A wrapper to help manage the code that is running. There are lots of lexical environments, and which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts.
